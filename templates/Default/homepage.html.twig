<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that\'s what you see at a toy store. And you must think you\'re in a toy store, because you\'re here shopping for an infant named Jeb. </p>

<p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I\'m not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain\'s going to be? He\'s the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they\'re friends, like you and me! I should\'ve known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>
